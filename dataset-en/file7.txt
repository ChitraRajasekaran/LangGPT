Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\\ Just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\\ Right now, there are the following gestures available:\ move right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\ move left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\ move up and back down - Up (Alt+Up)\ circle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\\ The gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\\ Note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once. For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\\ The conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains'konqueror ').

List of all Callers This list shows all functions calling the current selected one, either directly or with several functions in-between on the stack; the number of functions in-between plus one is called the Distance (e. g. for function A, B, C there exists a call from A to C when A calls B and B calls C, i. e. A = > B = > C. The distance here is 2). Absolute cost shown is the cost spent in the selected function while a listed function is active; relative cost is the percentage of all cost spent in the selected function while the listed one is active. The cost graphic shows logarithmic percentage with a different color for each distance. As there can be many calls from the same function, the distance column sometimes shows the range of distances for all calls happening; then, in parentheses, there is the medium distance, i. e. the distance where most of the call costs happened. Selecting a function makes it the current selected one of this information panel. If there are two panels (Split mode), the function of the other panel is changed instead.

And thus We showed Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, so that he might become one of those who have sure faith.. The adversaries are told that they can observe God's signs in the phenomena of the universe, just as Abraham could. The difference is that they see nothing, as if they were blind, whereas Abraham saw with open eyes. The sun, moon and stars which rise and set before their eyes day after day and night after night witness them as misguided at their setting as at their rising. Yet the same signs were observed by the perceptive Abraham, and the physical phenomena helped him arrive at the Truth.

The Prophet is closer to the believers than their ownselves, and his wives are their (believers') mothers (as regards respect and marriage).

This has been written in the (Allah's Book of Divine) Decrees (AlLauh AlMahfuz)."

Scheduled Printing Scheduled printing lets you control the time of the actual printout, while you can still send away your job now and have it out of your way. Especially useful is the "Never (hold indefinitely)" option. It allows you to park your job until a time when you (or a printer administrator) decides to manually release it. This is often required in enterprise environments, where you normally are not allowed to directly and immediately access the huge production printers in your Central Repro Department. However it is okay to send jobs to the queue which is under the control of the operators (who, after all, need to make sure that the 10,000 sheets of pink paper which is required by the Marketing Department for a particular job are available and loaded into the paper trays.)

O Prophet (Muhammad SAW)! Verily, We have made lawful to you your wives, to whom you have paid their Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), and those (captives or slaves) whom your right hand possesses - whom Allah has given to you, and the daughters of your 'Amm (paternal uncles) and the daughters of your 'Ammah (paternal aunts) and the daughters of your Khal (maternal uncles) and the daughters of your Khalah (maternal aunts) who migrated (from Makkah) with you, and a believing woman if she offers herself to the Prophet, and the Prophet wishes to marry her; a privilege for you only, not for the (rest of) the believers. Indeed We know what We have enjoined upon them about their wives and those (captives or slaves) whom their right hands possess, - in order that there should be no difficulty on you. And Allah is Ever OftForgiving, Most Merciful.

Men are the managers of the affairs of women for that God has preferred in bounty one of them over another, and for that they have expended of their property.

Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth.

They (the Jews, Quraish pagans, idolaters, etc.) did not estimate Allah with an estimation due to Him when they said: "Nothing did Allah send down to any human being (by inspiration)." Say (O Muhammad SAW): "Who then sent down the Book which Musa (Moses) brought, a light and a guidance to mankind which you (the Jews) have made into (separate) papersheets, disclosing (some of it) and concealing (much). And you (believers in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad SAW), were taught (through the Quran) that which neither you nor your fathers knew." Say: "Allah (sent it down)." Then leave them to play in their vain discussions. (Tafsir Al-Qurtubi, Vol. 7, Page 37).

And were such a Qur’an to come that would cause the mountains to move, or the earth to split asunder, or the dead to speak, even then these disbelievers would not believe; in fact, all matters are only at Allah’s discretion; so have not the Muslims despaired in that, had Allah willed, He would have guided all mankind? Disasters shall continue to strike the disbelievers on account of their deeds, or descend near their homes until Allah’s promise comes; indeed Allah does not break the promise.

The focus policy is used to determine the active window, i. e. the window you can work in. Click to focus: A window becomes active when you click into it. This is the behavior you might know from other operating systems. Focus follows mouse: Moving the mouse pointer actively on to a normal window activates it. New windows will receive the focus, without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly. Very practical if you are using the mouse a lot. Focus under mouse: The window that happens to be under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, the last window that was under the mouse has focus. New windows will not automatically receive the focus. Focus strictly under mouse: Only the window under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, nothing has focus. Note that'Focus under mouse 'and'Focus strictly under mouse' prevent certain features such as the Alt+Tab walk through windows dialog in the KDE mode from working properly.

Gardens of Eternity which they will enter: beneath them flow (pleasant) rivers: they will have therein all that they wish: thus doth Allah reward the righteous,-
But those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what is sent down to Muhammad -- and it is the truth from their Lord -- He will acquit them of their evil deeds, and dispose their minds aright.
Such people will never weaken God's (power) on earth nor will they find any guardian besides God. Their punishment will be doubled and they will not be able to hear or see.

Who is more unjust then he who invents a falsehood, ascribing it to Allah, or who rejects His revelation as false? Their full portion of God's Decree shall reach them, until Our deputed angels come to them to take charge of their souls, and say: 'Where are the deities now, those whom you invoked besides Allah?' They will say: 'They are all gone away from us.' And they shall bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers.

O mankind! This Noble Messenger (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so accept faith for your own good; and if you disbelieve, then undoubtedly to Allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and in the earth; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise.

Your Lord knows that you stand up praying for nearly two-thirds of the night, or one-half of it and sometimes one third of it, as do others among your followers. God determines the measure of night and day. He knows that you will not be able to do it, so He has turned to you in mercy. Recite, then, as much of the Quran as is easy for you. He knows that there will be some among you who may be sick and others who will be travelling throughout the land seeking God's bounty, and yet others who may be fighting for the cause of God. So, recite, then as much of it as you are able, and be constant in prayer, and spend in charity, and give to God a goodly loan. For whatever good deed you send on before you for your souls, you will find it with God. It will be improved and richly rewarded by Him. Seek God's forgiveness, He is most forgiving, most merciful.
Nor do they spend anything (in Allah's Cause) - small or great - nor cross a valley, but is written to their credit, that Allah may recompense them with the best of what they used to do (i.e. Allah will reward their good deeds according to the reward of their best deeds which they did in the most perfect manner).

It is He Who has revealed the Book to you. Some of its verses are absolutely clear and lucid, and these are the core of the Book. Others are ambiguous. Those in whose hearts there is perversity, always go about the part which is ambiguous, seeking mischief and seeking to arrive at its meaning arbitrarily, although none knows their true meaning except Allah. On the contrary, those firmly rooted in knowledge say: 'We believe in it; it is all from our Lord alone.' No one derives true admonition from anything except the men of understanding.

When you divorce women and they complete their term [of waiting], then either retain them honourably or release them honourably, and do not retain them maliciously in order that you may transgress; and whoever does that certainly wrongs himself.
