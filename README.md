Build your own ML model, deploy it and integrate the ML model into frontend application.
Our model's task is to translate texts from English to Native language.

BUILD THE LANGGPT MODEL:

1) First we will build all components of transofrmer model block by block
2) Then, we will assemble all the blocks to build our model
3) After that, we will train and validate our model with the dataset that we are going to get from hugging face dataset
4) Finally we will test our model by performing translation on new translation text data

DEPLOY THE MODEL:



CREATE A FRONTEND:



If you want to try it for the language you speak, do the following:

- change the dataset
- excute every step to train the model with your native language
- deploy the model
- connect it with the front end (You dont have to create anything new here unless you want a different UI)
